### Product Organization

Products are organizaed in different axis. The first axis is brand. Then there is the category/type axis and finally the name axis. We don't use variants, but rather group products togheter using the name. Related products ( variants ) have exaclty the same name up until de ":" column character. Anything after the ":" is the variant.

Variants are used to help use users select related products, when a user is selecting a product
