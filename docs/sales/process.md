#### Order Process

1. Draft
It's the default status for all new orders. 
Orders are generated by two types of users, call center executives and salesman on the road using tablets.


1. Waiting Approval
It's waiting for the billing department to approve

2. Approved
Approved orders are ready to print. 
Only users from the billing department can approve users.
Permissions are handled on the API.

3. On Hold
Orders that are waiting for payment, or other sort of approval. 
They could also very rarely be waiting for inventory to arrive from the harbor.

4. On Route
Approved orders ready to be invoiced, but waiting for the day they will be shipped. 
They can be here 1-2 days.

5. Archived
Final state of all orders when invoiced.
Deleted orders are simply deleted.
Archived orders can't be deleted, or modified.
